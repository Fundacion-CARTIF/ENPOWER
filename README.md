# ENPOWER

ENPOWER is redefining the energy landscape by bringing together cutting-edge technology, community engagement, and innovative business models.
The aim of CARTIF is to Develop an interactive decision support tool, accessible to energy citizens (inlcuding innovative social-driven incentive mechanisms) in order to incentivise their participation as prosumers in self-consumption structures, either in an individual way or as members of an energy community. 

The developed tool will allow users to assess the benefits (economic, social, etc.) of becoming a prosumer or joining an energy community and assess different scenarios (size of technologies, etc.)

Give citizens access to knowledge and information as well as help them to define their local energy community, enabling consumers to take the lead to actively participate in the energy activities. 

Therefore, the planning tool aims to:
- [ ] Visualize their current status (baseline)
- [ ] Compute and calculate different future scenarios to improve their energy system
- [ ] Get related-energy communities’ information about their countries to learn and make informed decisions
​​- [ ] Analyse the benefits of joining an energy community VS doing the same actions individually​
